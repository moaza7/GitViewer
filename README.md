# GitViewer 📝👀

This repository contains a simple program where the user is allowed to register and login with a username and password of their choice. Once logged in, the program will redirect the user to my github profile. This was developed using JavaFX, and the login screen was edited and created in SceneBuilder. This will be helpful in my journey of becoming a successful developer, and help me get more engagement on my GitHub profile. Here are some of the concepts you may need to be familiar with to work with this:
- Basics of JavaFX
- FXML and Controllers
- WebView Component
- Basics of SceneBuilder
